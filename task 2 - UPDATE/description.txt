The folder contains python file (recipe_database.py) with the code, templates fodler with templates for tables and forms and PNG file with database ER diagram.
The database contains 3 tables: recipe, ingredient, recipe_ingred. Recipe contains IDs (primary key) and names (unique) of recipies. IDs are integer values having AUTO_INCREMENT feature, which automatically prescribes ID to new recipies. Ingredient contains ingredient IDs (primary key with AUTO_INCREMENT) and ingredient names (unique). Recipe_ingred table has 3 columns: ID of recipe, ID of corresponding ingredient (both IDs form primary key) and amount of that ingredient. This table references two other tables through foreign keys. ON DELETE(UPDATE) CASCADE is added, so if a record is deleted (updated) from recipe or ingredient table it will be deleted (updated) in recipe_ingred table too.
